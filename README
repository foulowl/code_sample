Hello,

As requested, I have written a short chef recipe that will allow you to do the following:

1. Install nginx.
2. Serve requests to nginx on port 8000.
3. Serve the content found here: https://github.com/puppetlabs/exercise-webpage
4. Remove the nginx "default" site symlink.

All other nginx configuration has been left as the default as requested.

If you wish to use this on more systems, the procedure is the following:

1. Clone this repo to your workstation.
2. Spin up new server running debian 8.
3. This server should have the "deploy" user created, and the public key on your workstation added to the deploy user's authorized_keys file. I would be happy to explain this procedure if desired.
4. Be sure to disable root login for ssh, and disable ssh password based login for security reasons.
5. Run visudo on your new server and add the following line to allow the deploy user to sudo without a password: 
deploy ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
6. Run ./deploy.sh deploy@<hostname> 

Please note that running this will restart nginx. (normally I would do a reload, but looks like there is a problem with systemd where this is not working)

If you would like this script to work for red hat based systems, please let me know as it would only take a small amount of modification to our scripts to get that working as well.

You should be all set! Please let me know if you have any questions here.
